What project did you have last time?
My last project was the website of the PlexTV streaming platform.
I tested the desktop version of this platform (of it)
We tested the Search Results Page (SRP) system. We found what didnâ€™t work at this website about search feature.

I have hobbies. I like when I do something myself hands. For example, I created solar power plant in my house. It worked. I was gladded. 
And next I created tracer system for it. It was in the February in this year. 
This is system tracking the movement of the sun and keeping solar panel perpendicularly in relation to the sun so it worked on the maximum efficiency. And I used to do many other homemade else.

Why did I select QA engineer position?
Because I did work with Quality all my life. Many years I had got experience of development and implementation quality management system on the Ukrainian companies under ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and other international standard. 
This is direction in early for my heart. I am perfect understanding what is the Quality assurance and the Quality Control . 
And I am really recognizing difference between them.
